# OneFaceCubeSolver - Python Program

## Overview

This Python program generates a possible configuration of a Rubik's Cube  based on the provided data of **one face** of the cube. By inputting the colors of one side of the cube, the program calculates and outputs a possible configuration of the cube's 

## Features

- **Single Face Input:** You only need to provide one face of the cube as input (in a 3x3 grid format).
- **Cube Evaluation:** The program evaluates based on the provided face and generates possible configurations.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the program by executing `python main.py`.

## Usage

### 1. Provide Input Face
The program expects a single 3x3 grid of colors for one face of the cube. The format should be a list of lists, like this:

```python
Example: w w w
         w w w
         w w w
```
